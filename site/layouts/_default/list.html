    	<p>I'm going to start this out by saying I'm still learning about the publishing industry. I can't say if self-publishing is better or worse than traditional publishing, but it seems to really come down to personal preference. If you write a quality book there's a good chance readers will find you either way.</p>
      <p>I decided to document my journey for my own reference. If you're planning to self-publish your book this information might be uselful for you too.</p>
