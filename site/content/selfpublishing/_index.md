  description: >-
    I'm still learning about the publishing industry. I can't say if
    self-publishing is better or worse than traditional publishing, but it seems
    to come down to personal preference. If you write a quality book and can get
    it out there then there's a good chance readers will find you (so says the
    internet anyway). I'm still working on getting my debut children's fantasy
    novel *SOMNIUM: Beyond the Darkness* (Book 1 in the [Somnium
    Series](https://www.somniumseries.com)) out there, so for me, the jury is
    still out.


    I wanted to document my journey for my own reference because when it's time to get book 2 out there I'm going to need this! I'm a big DIYer and self-publishing my book has been no different. So far I've done everything myself (and by everything I mean everything - from setting up my website to formatting my files for print). To give credit where credit is due, my talented artist/husband created my cover, but since he doesn't so that for a living I consider it part of my DIY journey. If you're planning to self-publish your book and want to try doing it yourself as well then you might find some of these posts helpful.
