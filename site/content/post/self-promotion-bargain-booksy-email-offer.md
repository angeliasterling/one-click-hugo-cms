[Written Word Media](https://www.writtenwordmedia.com/) offers a couple of different services to promote the eBook version of your book. I chose to promote via their [Bargain Booksy](https://www.writtenwordmedia.com/bargain-booksy/) list. To qualify your book needs to be priced below $5, but more than $.99. If your book is free they have a [Free Booksy](https://secure.writtenwordmedia.com/features/free-booksy) offering as well.

When you sign up for the service they recommend you also sign up for the email list you are targeting so you can see your offer come through. I would actually recommend signing up for the list **prior** to creating your campaign. Why? Because I signed up for the children's list and have since found that most of the children's books marketed to this list are picture books and not children's novels like my book.

My campaign got me 0 new purchases, so for me this was a big fail (thankfully only a $20 fail). I attribute part of this to marketing to what appears to be the wrong age group. I intend to run another promotion marketing to their Young Adult list and will update how that goes.

Would I do it again? Nope, at least not to the children's list.
