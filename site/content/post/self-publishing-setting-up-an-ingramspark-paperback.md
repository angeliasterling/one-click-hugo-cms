If you want to get your books into libraries, retailers and schools the best place to list your book is with IngramSpark. They can publish hardcover and paperbacks via [print on demand (POD)](/post/self-publishing-print-on-demand-pod/) as well as eBooks. If you intend to distribute your book beyond Amazon, this is the best way to do so. If you choose to distribute through Amazon they are using IngramSpark anyway.

When you set up a new title with IngramSpark you can choose to list both a paperback and eBook for $49, or the paperback for $49 and an eBook separately for $25.

I was enrolled with Amazon KDP Select when I set up my paperback with IngramSpark so I was unable to list my eBook. This is unfortunately going to cost me additional money down the road, but I felt it was useful for me to take advantage of Amazon KDP Select before expanding further.

**Paperback Document**

IngramSpark requires that your files be exported to a pdf **very** specifically to be considered ["print ready"](https://www.ingramspark.com/hubfs/downloads/file-creation-guide.pdf). For this reason, and to make things easier down the road, I would recommend formatting your book per IngramSpark requirements and then use that file for Amazon and Barnes & Noble. This will save you time down the road and make uploading a breeze.

Unlike Amazon, IngramSpark doesn't offer templates for your manuscript as far as I'm aware. I used the template I downloaded from Amazon and modified it to match the requirements for IngramSpark.

The biggest challenge I had with creating a file for IngramSpark was getting the pdf to meet their requirements. Unfortunately Pages doesn't have the export capabilities to create the file the way that they need. Their documentation references using Adobe Acrobat to create the file properly, however I don't have that application and it's expensive. I found I was able to use Affinity Designer to create the pdf and it resolved the errors I was receiving when I uploaded my pdf originally.

**Cover**

IngramSpark's cover requirements are **much** different from Amazon's, so don't expect to be able to use the same file. They do, thankfully, have a Cover Template Generator available within their Help section once you've begun setting up your title. The nice thing about this tool is that it places a barcode in the file for you based on your ISBN. I imagine having this barcode may come in handy should I decide to use a printer that doesn't provide a barcode.

**What you need**

In order to complete setup for your paperback you'll need the following:

* Your paperback ISBN. This should be the same ISBN used with Amazon so long as you [purchased your own](/post/self-publishing-purchasing-isbns/). If you chose to let Amazon assign an ISBN you won't be able to use that with IngramSpark.
* Your cover formatted properly.
* Your .pdf file formatted properly.
* Your author bio

I can't stress enough how important it is to format your files properly prior to uploading them. IngramSpark won't help you if they are formatted incorrectly and there will likely be a fee to upload them again, although I have read that during setup you may be able to re-upload your files if they don't meet the proper requirements without being charged.

**Listing**

It takes approximately 4-7 days for a book to be approved with IngramSpark. Once they approve your files they will request you do a final review of the files before you can enable them for distribution.

**Enabling for Distribution**

Before you enable your book to be available for distribution IngramSpark recommends you purchase a copy of the book for a final review to make sure everything looks the way you expect. Unfortunately they are slow to print and ship, so expect to wait 2-3 weeks to receive your book.

**Making Changes**

If you choose to make changes to your documents with IngramSpark it's going to cost you. Unlike Amazon, where you can make changes for free, there is a fee each time you want to make a change. For this reason it's best to wait until you are confident with your manuscript to upload your title.
