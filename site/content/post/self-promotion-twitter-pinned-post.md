I wasn't aware that most authors pin a post with their book details on Twitter. Frequently when other people follow you they look for your pinned post and retweet it.

When I first joined twitter I was envious of the nicely formatted pinned post or "ads" that other authors were using instead of seeing the standard & basic details that link from Amazon.

It turns out these are pretty easy to add.

If you are savvy with any image creation software you just need to create a jpg that's 1200px x 675px and it will properly fill the available space in the preview on twitter. I found this important because although you can upload a taller image, not all of it is visible and you end up losing valuable information unless someone clicks to open it. It looks a lot nicer if all your important information is right there to see as people scroll by in their feed.

Once you have your image you can create a tweet by uploading the image you created, and you can still link to amazon or wherever else you sell your book.

For example I added the image to my pinned tweet with the following copy:
