Setting up an Author Page on Amazon is quick and easy. I like that it adds content to your book page by adding a biography section and links together all of your books with you as the author. It also gives you access to some additional reporting where you can see some sales information and your book reviews can be found here as well.

**Set up an account**

You can [set up an account](https://authorcentral.amazon.com/) at anytime, but you won't be able to link it to your books until they exist in Amazon's system.

**What you'll need**

* Your biography copy (no html supported)
* Your author photo (see below)
* A link to the RSS feed of your blog (if you have one)
* Your book titles or ISBNs to link to your account

**Author Photo**

Due to the styling Amazon uses of the headshot (round in most places) it's best to upload a square image so it displays the way you want. Otherwise, Amazon adds white strips to fill in the blank space, which looks pretty terrible when it has rounded corners.

**Linking Books**

Amazon says they link your different formats together (eBook & print), but even though my books were linked in my KDP account they weren't linked on their product page. This was extremely important to me so that it's easy for customers to see how they can read my book. Amazon tells you to wait at least a week, and if they still aren't linked then [contact them for help](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200652220).
