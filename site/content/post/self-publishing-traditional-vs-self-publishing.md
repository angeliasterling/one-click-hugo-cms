I'm going to start this out by saying I don't know much about the publishing industry in general and I'm certainly no expert (I'm very much learning as I go). I can't say if self-publishing is better or worse than traditional publishing, but based on what I've read, it really comes down to personal preference. If you write a quality book there's a good chance readers will find you either way.

So with that in mind, I decided that self-publishing was the lesser of two evils. I was quickly turned off by the idea of traditional publishing due to the lengthy process (and expected rejections) of sending out query letters to literary agents before even getting to a publisher. While having the backing of a publisher is appealing for many reasons, not seeing my book reach the market for months, years, (ever?) didn't appeal to me.

Self-publishing has its own list of down sides as well, much of which boil down to having to commit to the investment and doing the work yourself. Time & money my friends.

1. Time

   * Researching what to do and how to do it.
   * If you're going to upload your book to various platforms (like Amazon, IngramSpark and Barnes & Noble) expect to spend a fair amount of time formatting and reformatting your files based on their unique requirements.
   * Getting your book out there, whether through social media, contacting book stores directly or creating your own marketing materials.
   * Setting up a website, unless you opt to have someone else do it for you. In which case, more money.
2. Money

   * A quality editor is going to cost you.
   * Purchasing your own ISBNs, which I highly recommend.
   * Setting up a website and having your own domain name.
   * With no publisher backing you, you're only going to make money on what sells. So no one's paying you to write that next novel.
   * Depending on how and where you decide to try and distribute your book there can be costs associated with listing it.
   * If you want to give out copies of your book you have to purchase them yourself.
   * The cost for marketing and promotional materials comes out of your pocket.
   * Anything you can't do yourself you'll need to hire someone else to do, like creating your cover.

I have a unique background that positioned me well to take all this on. My background is web development, so navigating self-publishing websites and setting up my own was all doable for me. I also had the great fortune to have grown up in a printing business, so I understand the terminology and have experience with all of the software used in creating the necessary files. And perhaps luckiest of all, I'm married to an artist so I was able to get my cover created free of charge.

All of this made self-publishing a no brainer for me. I was able to get my book out to consumers quickly, which allows me to get realtime feedback as I work on my next novel. 

There are undoubtedly other down sides to self-publishing that I've yet to discover. But for now, I'm happy to have my book out there to share with others.
