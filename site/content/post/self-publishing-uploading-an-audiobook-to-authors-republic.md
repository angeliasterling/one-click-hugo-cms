**Set up an account**

The first thing you'll need to do is set up an account at [www.authorsrepublic.com](https://authorsrepublic.com/).

**Audio Files**

If you follow the [specifications for ACX](https://www.acx.com/help/acx-audio-submission-requirements/201456300) you will be able to use the same files for Author's Republic. The exception being the sample if you must provide a 5 minute or less sample based on length. An exactly 5 minute sample won't be accepted so you'll need to shorten it.

**Cover**

If you follow the [ACX's specifications](https://audible-acx.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6654/kw/cover%20art) for the cover you will be able to use the same cover file for Author's Republic.

**What you need**

In order to complete setup for your audiobook you'll need the following:

* If you want to use [your own ISBNs](/post/self-publishing-setting-up-an-isbn/) you will need to set up two different ISBNs for the digital version of your book and for the digital library version.
* Your cover
* Your audio files
* The suggested price you want to list your book for, although the distributers can set their own price.

**Contract**

When you set up your audiobook you will need to sign a contract similar to that with ACX. As with ACX, the big thing to note with the contract is that you must give Author's Republic the rights to distribute your audiobook for 7 years. This seems like a long time, but there's no way around it.

**Distributers**

You can distribute to ACX through Author's Republic, but if you choose to[ list with ACX directly](/post/self-publishing-uploading-an-audiobook-to-acx/) then you won't select to distribute to them via Author's Republic. You can also choose to distribute to music distributers, but I chose not to as it didn't seem like the right platform for my book.

**Listing**

Author's Republic states that it takes 3 weeks on average for your audiobook to be reviewed and accepted. Unfortunately each distributer will have their own timeline and it's not communicated to you when it's available on each. I found that some where much quicker than others and within a week my audiobook was available through some distributers.

**Making Changes**

It appears you can make changes to your audiobook, but in order to do so you must contact customer service so your title is available for editing.
