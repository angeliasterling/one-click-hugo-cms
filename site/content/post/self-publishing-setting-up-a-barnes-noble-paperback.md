**Set up an account**

The first thing you'll need to do is create a new account at [press.barnesandnoble.com](https://press.barnesandnoble.com/). B&N has the nicest, most user-friendly UI out of Amazon KDP and IngramSpark. If you aren't super familiar with what you're doing or how to properly format files they do an excellent job of walking you through what's needed.

Formatting Guide

B&N offers a [complete guide](http://www2.nookassets.com/npassets-spb/pod/resources/BN-Press-Formatting-Guide-v1.pdf) on how to properly format your files for their services.

**Paperback Document**

Barnes & Noble requires a very similar layout to IngramSpark's paperback requirements, so I used the same interior [pdf file I created for IngramSpark](/post/self-publishing-setting-up-an-ingramspark-paperback/). This worked out perfectly and I didn't need to make any changes for it to upload and print properly.

**Cover**

Unfortunately the cover file was another story. Barnes & Noble's spine ended up being a tiny bit smaller than the cover for both Amazon KDP and IngramSpark. Presumably they use thinner paper because the page count was identical. Due to this difference I needed another cover file created specific for B&N. During the book creation they offer a Cover Template that can be used to make sure your bleeds and fold marks line up properly based on your specific size book & page length.

**What you need**

In order to complete setup for your paperback you'll need the following:

* Unfortunately B&N requires a unique ISBN. This is somewhat irksome assuming it's the identical book as what is listed on Amazon KDP and IngramSpark. The ISBN agency, Bowker, doesn't recommend using a different ISBN for the same book, but the only way to proceed with listing is to use a new [ISBN you've purchased](/post/self-publishing-purchasing-isbns/).
* Your cover formatted properly as a pdf.
* Your .pdf file or Word doc of your manuscript.
* Your Author Bio copy

**Listing**

B&N states print books will be available within 96 hours, but my book was available for sale within a couple of days.

**Making Changes**

In order to make changes you first have to take your book offline and then republish it. During this time period I don't believe your book will appear for sale, but I have yet to make updates so I can't be certain.
