**Goodreads**

This is probably one of the most important social platforms to be on as an author (in my opinion), particularly because it's all about books.

**Twitter**

Twitter has a large community of fellow authors who are great for providing inspiration, guidance and advice. I have also connected with an audience of people who read books in my genre.

**Instagram**

I created an instagram account dedicated to me as an "author" to share writing inspired images. I haven't gained any traction there, mostly because I'm not as active and haven't done much to actively engage with others. For now, it's just a fun place for me to post images when I can, which I use to add content for my website.

**Facebook**

I didn't create an author specific profile page on Facebook, but it's definitely something to consider. I keep my friends & family on Facebook updated with details about my book, but I didn't think I'd find many followers there and so haven't pursued this avenue as an author.

**Pinterest**

I set up a [business Pinterest account](https://business.pinterest.com/) mostly to share posts I create that are more of the DIY sort (like [Screen Printing T-Shirts using a Cricut](/post/self-promotion-screen-printing-t-shirts-using-a-cricut/)). The business account shares some interesting insights, like how many views your pin has had or how many times it's been re-pinned. At this time I don't intend to market my posts there, but I find it a lovely way to create inspiration boards for books and for myself as an author.
