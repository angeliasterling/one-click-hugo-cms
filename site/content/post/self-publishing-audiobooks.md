description: Releasing your book in audiobook format
---
Audiobooks are huge and I'm excited to see how well my book performs in this format. I had originally intended to work with a professional narrator, but when it fell through I decided to give recording the audiobook myself a try. It was time consuming, but overall it cost a significant amount less and I was able to tweak the files until I was satisfied vs having to pay for re-recordings.

If you are thinking about releasing your book as an audiobook, I highly recommend considering reading it yourself. I consider it a treat when I get to hear the author read their own books.

From what I saw originally you're looking at about $1,000 - $5,000 depending on the narrator you choose to work with and the length of your book (if you're paying upfront). Also expect it to take at least a month to be produced and returned to you.

To record myself, the cost of equipment was about $300. It took me about 3 weeks to record and edit, spending approximately 2-3 hours per day on it. I own 100% rights to the files. I consider this a huge win.

These are the platforms I decided to release my audiobook through:

* [ACX](https://www.acx.com/)

**ACX**

ACX allows you to publish your audiobook directly to Audible & iTunes. ACX also offers other services that connect you with narrators who can audition to read your book at varying pricing. Read the fine print on these deals though, some of them sound pretty limiting. For example you could get yourself locked into a 7 year exclusive deal with ACX and be required to pay higher royalties if you don't pay for the audiobook upfront. Since I decided to record the book myself I didn't explore this avenue.
