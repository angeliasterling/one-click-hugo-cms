I'm going to start this out by saying I don't know much about the publishing industry in general and I'm certainly no expert (I'm very much learning as I go). I can't say if self publishing is better or worse than traditional publishing, but based on what I've read from other author's it really comes down to personal preference. If you write a quality book there's a good chance readers will find you either way.

So with that in mind, I decided that self publishing was the lesser of two evils. I was quickly turned off by the idea of traditional publishing due to the lengthy process (and expected rejections) of sending out query letters to literary agents before the prospect of even getting to a publisher could happen. While having the backing of a publisher is appealing for many reasons, not seeing my book reach the market for months, years (ever?) didn't appeal to me.

Self publishing has its own list of down sides as well, much of which boil down to having to do the work yourself. This includes (but is not limited to):

1. Time

   1. If you're going to upload your book to various platforms (like Amazon, IngramSpark and Barnes & Noble) expect to spend a fair amount of time formatting and reformatting based on their unique requirements.
   2. I've been spending a lot of time trying to get my book out there via social media, contacting book stores directly and creating my own marketing materials.
2. Money

   1. With no publisher backing me, I'm only making money on what sells and I'm certainly not getting paid to write a sequel.
   2. Depending on how and where you decide to try and distribute your book there can be a cost associated with listing your book
   3. If you want to give out copies of your book you have to purchase them yourself.
3. Marketing

   1. With no publisher backing your book the only way to get it out there is yourself.

I have a unique background that positioned me well to take all this on. My profession is as an eCommerce web developer, so navigating these areas (while sometimes challenging) has been doable for me. I also had the great fortune to have grown up in a print shop run by my parents, so I understand the terminology. And perhaps luckiest of all, I'm married to an artist so I was able to get my cover created free of charge.

There are undoubtedly other down sides to self-publishing that I've yet to discover. But for now, I'm happy to have my book out there to share with others.
