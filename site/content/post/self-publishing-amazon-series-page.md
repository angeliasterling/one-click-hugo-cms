If you're publishing multiple books in a series be sure to take advantage of the ability to link the books together. This has a couple of benefits:

* The books will be merchandized together on your product page in Amazon in a couple of ways. 

  * Under the title and star ratings a "Book 1 of 2" (for example) will display with a link to the Series page. 
  * A "Next in the Series" section will appear
  * and a "Books in the Series" section will also appear

* Another great thing is that the Kindle app will also merchandize your next book in the series when someone finishes a book in the app

**Setting up a Series**

Setting up a series is really easy on Amazon KDP. When you are [setting up your eBook](adsterling.com/post/self-publishing-setting-up-an-amazon-ebook/) or [paperback](https://www.adsterling.com/post/self-publishing-setting-up-an-amazon-paperback/) on Amazon simply add the series information in the Series section. If you've already published a book and are adding a new one then go back into your old book and add the series or create the series on your Bookshelf page and link your books there. This will automatically create the series page for you.

**Modifying the Series Page**

There isn't much you can do to modify your series  page, but you can add custom text for the series. If you don't set this then it will default to the description text for your first book. To edit the details click the series link on the Bookshelf page that appears under any of the titles in your series. This will open up a new page. From here you can:

* Reorder your books
* Add more books
* Select "edit series details" - from here you can 

  * choose if your series is ordered or un-ordered (can be read in any order)
  * add custom text for the series
