**Set up an account**

The first thing you'll need to do is create a new account at [play.google.com/books/publish](https://play.google.com/books/publish/). If you have a gmail account you can choose to use that account as well.

**EPUB File**

If you've already created [an EPUB file](/post/self-publishing-creating-an-epub-file/) this should be a simple set up. You can also upload a pdf file, but EPUB files are pretty universally accepted so I found it easier to use the same file everywhere. 

**What you need**

In order to complete setup for your eBook you'll need the following:

* Your eBook ISBN if you are using an [ISBN you've purchased](/post/self-publishing-purchasing-isbns/).
* I was able to use the cover I created for [Amazon KDP](/post/self-publishing-setting-up-an-amazon-ebook/) following their [formatting specifications](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200645690).
* Your .epub file
* Your book details

**Listing**

Google can take up to 5 days to get your book listed, but I found it to be much quicker than that.
