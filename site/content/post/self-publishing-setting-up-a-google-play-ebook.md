**Set up an account**

The first thing you'll need to do is create a new account at [press.barnesandnoble.com](https://press.barnesandnoble.com/). B&N has the nicest, most user-friendly UI out of Amazon KDP and IngramSpark. If you aren't super familiar with what you're doing or how to properly format files they do an excellent job of walking you through what's needed.

**EPUB File**

If you've already created [an EPUB file](/post/self-publishing-creating-an-epub-file/) this should be a simple set up. You can also upload a doc/docx, txt, html file, but EPUB files are pretty universally accepted so I found it easier to use the same file everywhere. 

**What you need**

In order to complete setup for your eBook you'll need the following:

* Your eBook ISBN if you are using an [ISBN you've purchased](/post/self-publishing-purchasing-isbns/).
* I was able to use the cover I created for [Amazon KDP](/post/self-publishing-setting-up-an-amazon-ebook/) following their [formatting specifications](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200645690).
* Your .epub file
* Your book details

**Listing**

B&N states that it can take up to 2 days for a book to show up in the store.

**Making Changes**

In order to make changes you first have to take your book offline and then republish it. During this time period I don't believe your book will appear for sale, but I have yet to make updates so I can't be certain.
