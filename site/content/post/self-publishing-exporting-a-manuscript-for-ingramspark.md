Exporting your file properly for IngramSpark is extremely important to avoid issues down the road. Don't forget, it costs money to re-upload your files, so you really want to get it right the first time. To do this I used Affinity Designer which is Affinity's version of Adobe Illustrator. 

* Download and install [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) if you don't already have it.
* Open your document in Affinity Designer. I created my manuscript in Pages on my Mac so I had to first export it as a PDF and I then open it in Affinity Designer with the following screen. (I'm not sure where the missing font I had came from, but I used Garamond as my general font so I chose to replace it with that font.)

* Choose the File menu ad then Export
* On this screen select the PDF tab
* Update to use the following settings

* Click the "More" button
* Update to use the following settings (if you have a lot of images in your document you may want to deselect "Allow JPEG compression", but as I had limited graphics in my book I chose to keep this selected)

When using these settings I did not have any errors when uploading my pdf to IngramSpark
